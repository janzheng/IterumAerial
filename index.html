The rest of the students all had their quills out and at the ready, and I could see that some of them had already marked and annotated their books. I didn’t know a single person in the room; other students were required to be a 5th Year to even take the class, and it was recommended only for 7th Years. But Headmistress Chang had specifically mandated that I take this course and gave me an exception. Hermione Granger was the only other student to ever be granted an exception for this class, and she was still a 4th Year when she did it. Headmistress Chang insisted that creating new spells and discovering magic on your own was the very essence of what Althea Ambaret would have wanted, so I had to take it.

  “Theory of Magic will be one of the most dangerous courses you have ever taken here at Hogwarts,” she said calmly. “New spells are volatile and often the magic manifests in some very unpredictable ways.” Headmistress Chang had warned me of that, though she did try to downplay it.
  “It is not a subject to ever be taken lightly,” Professor Hima continued, “and every single day in this class will require your utmost attention and skill. You will not be reading instructions out of a book and using tried and true methods. You will be creating your own spells and honing them through trial and error.” She gestured at all of the safety equipment around the room, all worn and scarred from previous classes. “There is no slacking off in this subject, which is why it is only approved for the very best students.” Everyone else in the room had a proud or smug smile plastered across their faces, but that statement just made my stomach roil and churn. I hardly knew any spells, much less enough to make my own.
  “As you already know, I am Professor Hima. Unlike your other classes, I won’t just be standing here lecturing on you. This class requires you to embrace your own creativity and ingenuity to come up with a spell. You will develop a thorough understanding of the Laws of Magical Motion, Magical Conservation, and of course the Fundamental Laws of Magic.” The rest of the students nodded along as though that made perfect sense, but I’d never heard of any of those. I’d read the assigned first chapter of the book, but it had just talked about different wand movements and incantations….
  “Now before we begin,” she said, turning to look me in the eyes, “I want to address one student in particular.” She hadn’t said my name, but she may as well have. I felt my cheeks burning a brilliant scarlet as the rest of the class looked back. They all knew that I was the one who didn’t fit in here. I tried shrinking down into my desk, but it couldn’t hide me. “I want you all to welcome Ms. Deliah Murray, first student of House Ambaret.” There was a chorus of sullen ‘hellos’ from the other pupils.
  “As experienced students,” the Professor said, “you should all help her whenever possible, because this course may be… difficult for a first year.” The grimaces on their faces made it clear that they had no intention of helping the little kid who had somehow wormed her way into a top-level class. “But the ability to create spells will be invaluable to this new method of teaching that Headmistress Chang is allowing for House Ambaret’s pupil.”
  “Now, for a little demonstration,” she said. I breathed a sigh of relief as the other students all went back to ignoring me. “We’ll start off with something fairly simple. You’re all familiar with Aguamenti, of course.” The other students all nodded while I looked down at my book. I’d never heard of it. “Well, what if we didn’t want it to dispense water?” She summoned a cauldron from nearby and loudly announced “Igneamenti!” Instead of water, hot lava poured out of the tip of her wand, hissing into the metal canister. A blast of heat washed over the room. Professor Hima waved her wand again, and the magma disappeared. “Butterbeermenti!” she announced, receiving a chorus of laughs from the room. Amber butterbeer spouted from the tip of her wand and splashed into the cauldron. She cycled through a dozen different liquids of various colors and consistencies.
  “Now, this is a simple one, using established ingredients and just modifying an existing spell. Soon you’ll all be able to do the same, and then we can move on to creating spells from scratch.”
  The other students were all whispering to each other, planning out which spells they’d want to alter first. I looked down at my own wand, about as useless as a normal stick. The only spell I’d learned so far was “lumos.” I could already tell that this class was not going to go well for me. Why had I even been picked for House Ambaret?
